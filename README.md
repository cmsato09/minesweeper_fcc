# Minesweeper tutorial project

## Project Description

This is a minesweeper game made using Python's Tkinter following a tutorial 
posted by [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/object-oriented-programming-with-python-code-a-minesweeper-game/), originally by [JimShapedCoding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqbGRZx4xUc)

This tutorial covers object-oriented programming by creating a class for a 
"cell" in minesweeper. By left-clicking or right-clicking a cell, specific 
actions should occur and the number of cells left should be tracked. 

This tutorial also covers the algorithm associated with displaying the number
of mines surrounding a particular cell, open surrounding cells if the 
surrounding cells has no mines, and randomizing mine placement.
The basics of tkinter is touched upon, but not expanded. 

## How to Install

1. Copy from Github project
2. Make sure you have cell.py, main.py, and settings.py downloaded

## How to Run

Run the main.py file to play the game. It will open a Tkinter interface.
